- Interactive Simulation of Galaxy Formations

    2015, Peter Lee (yauyul@andrew.cmu.edu)


A visualization of early universe galaxy formation simulated using Volker
Springel's GADGET-1 program for cosmological simulations, and plotted using a
cuboid remapping method by J. Carson and M. White.

Files in the serial package of Gadget-1.1 are in the S-Gadget group, with
original copyright files included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build and run in Xcode to start the simulation. (*, **)

Point anywhere within the simulation to interact with the particles by adding
a repulsive force at the location of the pointer/touch.

Flip the switch to switch between repulsive/attractive force.

EDIT: The switch has been replaced with a slider, the top being attractive force
        and the bottom being repulsive

Pinch to adjust the scale, pan with two fingers to focus on different parts of
the simulation. (***)

EDIT: These gestures have been removed as zooming in is not necessary for the game

Four different initial condition files have been included in this package. Some
parameters will need to be changed to run the different simulations (details
in the parameter file parameterfiles/test.tex).

EDIT: More intial condition files have been added


** Note: Swift has gone through many version changes in the past year, and new
releases are likely to happen frequently in the future. Minor syntax changes
might be required before Xcode will compile this program. Most of these have
been solved

*** Note: Gestures are not refined for interaction since there were no tests
conducted on actual hardware.

Changes made to the original Gadget-1.1 distribution:

Renamed main.c to gadget_main.c to avoid compiler confusion.
Split the main() function for better control on initialization in background
thread, and to avoid duplicate _main symbols.
Removed many preprocessor macros, leaving mostly only relevant ones.

Renamed begrun.c to begrun.m, changing the compiler from C to Objective C,
thus allowing the NSBundle method of retriving and storing files to work

Other changed files (modifications detailed in each file):
  - allvars.c
  - allvars.h
  - begrun.m
  - init.c
  - run.c
  - read_ic.c
  - io.c
